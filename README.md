General Over View

The Makertron Client is a procedural parametric interface backed by a constructive solids engine that aims to fill the gap between traditional cad tools and modern manufacturing environments.

The design goal is that with the Makertron client and server code you can develop  complex constructive geometry at ‘scale’ and at ‘speed’ in a formal language. This is a step towards better adhenerence to design specifications and a more flexible ability to manage complex assembly and production tasks from the start of the design pipe lien all the way through to manufacturing. 

The Makertron server supports its own internal geometry engine based on a brep representation and a browser based client written in react using Three.js to front end generated geometry produced by the system. 


The Makertron engine supports a sophisticated transpiler that currently supports the default target of OpenSCAD.
